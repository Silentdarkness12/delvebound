READ THE FULL INSTRUCTIONS: IT IS YOUR FAULT IF YOU DO NOT!

As of typing this, this module is in an ALPHA state. If you use it, you are accepting that some things will either not work properly, or be broken. You are encouraged to report issues so I can fix them, and get this module in a more reasonably usable state.

This module adds content and modifies D&D's underlying code to allow a more seamless player and dungeon master experience playing Delvebound on foundry, built upon the 4.x version of the D&D Fifth Edition system. Attributes are renamed yet not broken, the unique TES features, classes, concepts and bestiaries are integrated(credits file included) along with a dearth of other information for DMs to use in making their campaigns fun and engaging in the realm of Tamriel.

Some efforts have been made to handle automation for most of the features in this module, thanks to new systems added to the 5e system with the 4.x update, but other parts may still require manual tweaking.

Instructions:

Go to releases and download the zip file, and extract the folder into your Foundry VTT modules folder.

Make sure to download and install all dependencies that this module requires, including Advanced Magic.

However, before using Delvebound, you will, for now, need to manually install a specific version of DAE that still technically supports (to my knowledge) D&D 4.x. Manually download this version of Dynamic Active Effects using the below manifest link:
https://gitlab.com/tposney/dae/raw/dndv4/package/module.json

Once you have everything installed and activated, you can find everything you are looking for in the Delvebound compendiums. There is one last step, however, for dungeon masters.

Once you are ingame in your server, open up the settings panel and go to the settings page for Advanced Magic. Change the settings to read the following: 
- Enable Spell Points Module: Set to on, check the box
- Open Spell Points Configuration:
 - * Character Sheet Resource Bar Color: Set Left Color to 58 R, 14 G, 95 B
 - * Character Sheet Resource Bar Color: Set Right Color to 138 R, 64 G, 199 B
 - * Animate Resource Bar: Turn on, check box
 - * Spell Points Preset: Set to Dungeon Master Guide(Custom)
 - * Enable Automatic Spell Points Progression: Check box
 - * Spell Points Progression: Progression Based on Caster Level, check box
 - * Enable Spell Points for NPC Actors: Check box

For any issues, come find me on the Delvebound discord server, let me know so I can attempt to fix it. I'm excited to do what I can to make this module come to life.
